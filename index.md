  # Hello Friend. Hello World.

  Hi, I’m a Computer Science student at Farmingdale State College and a full-stack developer. I love building apps from the ground up, focusing on intuitive design, clean code, and creativity. I’m proficient in **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, **React**, and more. Programming for me is the perfect blend of creativity and logic.

  Currently, I’m working on building full-stack applications and diving deeper into game development with Python as a hobby.

## Hello World

Hi, I’m a developer studying Computer Science at Farmingdale State College. I love building full-stack applications from the ground up—merging clean structure, intuitive design, and a bit of creativity along the way. I'm comfortable working across the stack and have experience with technologies like Spring Boot, Node.js, MySQL, and Azure.

Before tech, I studied integrative neuroscience and spent five years teaching chemistry. I’ve always enjoyed breaking down complex ideas and making them easier to understand—that mindset naturally carried over into programming. I also love art and creating things, so for me, coding is the perfect balance of creativity and logic.

In my spare time, I dabble in game development with Python—it’s a fun way to explore new ideas and stay curious. Whether I’m building an app or helping someone write their first line of code, I aim for clarity, intention, and work I can be proud of.
